# Welcome to Jr!

Jr is a static, static content generator that moves the "generator" part to the browser. A site is created using text files with a single Javascript included on each page that renders the theme and assets as needed.

This fork was created solely to showcase the ease of deploying the generator using GitHub Pages.

Check it out live here: https://ugotsta.github.io/jr/

## Usage on GitHub Pages

To use Jr on GitHub Pages:
- Ensure [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is enabled.
- Fork the original repo at https://github.com/Xeoncross/jr.
- Once the fork is created, go to `Settings` tab and enable GitHub Pages on the `Master` branch.

Your new site will be live at your-username.github.io/jr/. You can then make changes to the content and/or theme as needed.
